Work also well with different covariance combinaison
    Without PlantHeight, p-value = 0.169 and Test statistic = 9.078
    Without LeafWeight or TotalWeight, p-value = 0 and higher Test statistic -> strange

With the root covariance, p-value = 0.026 but Could not compute standard errors! The information matrix could
    not be inverted. This may be a symptom that the model is not
